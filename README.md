This repo was created as part of my course AI engineer course with IT Career Switch
Lesson "Building Your First AI Model"
https://itcs.discovermycareer.co.uk/courses/ai-fundamentals/lesson/building-your-first-ai-model/

There are two files here
1. Jupyter Notebook where I tried various commands to build the model
2. Python code src\train.py to run as a python program
